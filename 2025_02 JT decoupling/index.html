      In the first half of 2025, the EU Institute for Security Studies (EUISS)
      will publish a report on how the EU and partners can “fully de-risk”
      gallium, germanium, and rare earth supply chains before 2030. The EU’s
      current country-neutra lmix of policies to diversify material supply are
      movingfar too slow and don’t go far enough. As a result, the EU is likely
      to find itself deprived of these essential building blocks for its
      security and prosperity, if geopolitical tensions boil over, for example
      becausein the case of a military conflict over Taiwan.
    </p>
    <p>
      To complete phase 1 of this research project, the EUISS pooled the
      insights of a diverse group of European experts and stakeholders. We
      brought together over 30 representatives from the European Commission, EU
      Member States, think tanks, consultancies, research technology
      organisations (RTOs), refining and other downstream industries and
      semiconductor and other upstream industries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of the workshop goal: co-designingto co-design a policy package
      that can fully de-risk EU supply chains for these three materials by 2030
      . For the sake of the exercise , and to assess the impact of various
      policy measures, Wwe defined “fully de-risked” as reducing the EU’s
      (direct and indirect) dependence on China for these materials to zero. How
      can EU leaders accomplish this? We invited participants to gauge the 1.
      Effectiveness and 2. Negative consequences (for example environmental,
      economic, geopolitical externalities) of ten individual policy options.
      They did so in both a pre- and post-workshop expert survey. What follows
      is a summary of their definitive judgment, which participants gave after
      the four-hour workshop.
    </p>

    <h2>Workshop outcomes</h2>

    <p>
      Conclusion 1: A combination of promote, protect, and partner measures can
      accomplish a vertically integrated, China-free value chain by 2030 . No
      single policy offers a silver bullet, however. After all, no policy was
      deemed “extremely effective”, meaning a 9 or 10 score. Participants deem
      nine policies to be “net-effective” (5&lt;). Only four out of ten policies
      have “high negative consequences” (5&lt;). Participants stress that
      de-risking measures shouldwould need to target the entire supply chain.
      This is a precondition to achieve the 2030 goal. In addition, participants
      stress that introducing promote policies before protect policies is the
      best way forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conclusion 2: Providing various forms of financial support, for example to
      support mining and processing activities (Policy 2), stands out as by far
      the most promising tool to achieve the 2030 goal. After all, Policy 2
      seeks to overcometackle head-on the main obstacle to greater
      self-sufficiency: China’s predatory pricing. Participants warn that a
      failure to adopt Policy 2 may lead to the EU losing the limited production
      capacity it has at present. However, participants expect it to come at a
      relatively high cost (>5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Conclusion 3: One “no regret” and two “few regrets” policies should be
      implemented without delay. High effectiveness (8>X>6) and very low
      negative consequences (&lt;3) characterise investment in research,
      innovation, and talent (Policy 5.). Two “few regrets” options, namely
      stockpiling (Policy 1.) and streamlining permitting (Policy 6.) are
      considered to be highly effectivehave a high effectiveness (&gt;6) andwith
      low negative consequences (3&lt;X&lt;4).

      <div class="content-inner">
        <li>
          Large investment in research, innovation and local and foreign talent
          development (Policy 5) can help the EU and partners overcome key
          (technical) capability gaps. It has one important weakness: Policy 5
          may not produce results before 2030.
        </li>
        <li>
          Without a more efficient, streamlined permitting process (Policy 6),
          the 2030 de-risking goal is almost certainly out of reach.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stockpiling (Policy 1) can protect the EU against immediate effects of
          supply disruptions. This is especially true for critical sectors like
          the defence industry. For them, these materials and components are
          “high value, low volume”- commodities. Likewise, stockpiling can help
          generate the demand to kickstart production outside of China .
          Industry representatives have less faith in stockpiling than
          policymakers and think tankers .
        </li>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Conclusion 4: State investment (Policy 3), fiscal overseas support (Policy
      4), and G7+ economic security standards (Policy 9) offer “limited regret”
      options to help strengthen security of supply by 2030 . They are
      characterised by high effectiveness (>6) and only moderate negative
      consequences (5>X>4).

      <div class="content-inner">
        <li>
          State Investment (Policy 3) can produce a structural business case by
          ensuring investor stability, in the same way that investments by
          JOGMEC provide support on behalf of the Japanese government. Some
          participants deem Policy 3 even more helpful than financial support
          (Policy 2) because they suspect that EU producers would need
          structural support instead of a one-off capital injection. Yet, some
          participants argue that state investment (Policy 3) is expensive and
          potentially wasteful. Others point out that the EU and its Member
          States, unlike the Japanese government, lack the required flexibility
          and expertise.
        </li>
        <li>
          The participants find that fiscal overseas support (Policy 4) can
          complement policies that seek to promote production inside the EU.
          Many point out that investing in third countries with lower energy
          prices and regulatory burdens will improve the de-risking business
          case. Yet, questions about the future geopolitical alignmentlandscape,
          political stability, and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)-
          checks and balances of third countries remain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Introducing G7 and partner economic security standards in public
          procurement (Policy 9) enables EU and partner governments to stimulate
          production in trusted countries. Unlike Policies 2 and 3, pPolicy 9
          can achieve this without distorting competition between like-minded
          partners. Important questions remain, such as whether Trump 2.0 would
          consider being a part of a multilateral and slower approach.
          Participants warn of negative consequences: price hikes early on,
          retaliation by China, a loss of EU upstream industry competitiveness
          vis-à-vis like-minded partners, and strained relations with non-G7+
          countries. Notably, EU industry representatives express even more
          doubts and prefer “Buy European” provisions (Policy 7) instead.
        </li>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Conclusion 5: “Buy European” provisions (Policy 7) and introducing G7 and
      partner tariffs (Policy 10) are two “Moderate reward, high price.”-
      policies. Participants deem these policies to be net-effective (>5). Yet,
      both come with high negative consequences (>5). They may help contribute
      to reaching the 2030 goal, but only if the EU can introduce them at the
      right time and overcome their potentially severe negative consequences.

      <div class="content-inner">
        <li>
          “Buy European” provisions (Policy 7) may help spur greater material
          production in the EU, but it is unlikely that supply chains can be
          vertically integrated within the EU alone. Participants warn that
          pPolicy 107 leads to price increases, shortages, reciprocal
          protectionism by partners like the US and Canada, and retaliation by
          China. Industry representatives expect “Buy European” provisions to
          have few negative consequences.
        </li>

        <li>
          Participants expect G7 and partner import tariffs (Policy 10) to have
          more downside than upside, especially if introduced in the absence of
          promote measures. Even though these tariffs may protect EU and partner
          industries in the medium-term, it comes at a high cost. Policymakers
          expect Policy 10 to have severer negative consequences, but also to be
          more effective.
        </li>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Conclusion 6: Participants do not consider ESG requirements (Policy 8) an
      effective tool to create greater material security of supply. This is the
      only policy that participants considered “No gain. Just pain”. After all,
      Policy 8 stands out with by far the lowest expected effectiveness (&lt;4)
      and the highest negative consequences (&gt;6). It does not mean that it is
      a field shouldn’t be considered as important in the pursuit of other
      policy goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conclusion 7: Some participants propose additional policies. To achieve
      vertical integration, they advocate establishing like-minded industry
      networks, a loosening of state investment rules, and setting up a joint G7
      and partner development fund to invest in upstream industries outside of
      China. Finally, oOne participant advocates a G7+ stockpile information
      sharing and management system and to control investments from “foreign
      entities of concern” in upstream industries. Finally, measures such as
      lowering import duties or raising export tariffs on recyclable waste would
      help support the circular economy and ensure significant secondary supply
      sources, albeit in a time frame that is likely to be beyond 2030.

      Scenario 2030: China imposes a critical raw material export embargo
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="content-inner">
        <p>
          In early-March 2030 the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) finally
          blockades Taiwan. Washington responds, including on the economic
          front. Congress revives the Trading With The Enemy Act and uses it to
          ban all US-China trade. Washington pushes allies to cut -off
          commercial ties to China, as well too. Losing no time, the Bureau of
          Industry and Security (BIS) and the US Treasury introduce sweeping
          extraterritorial controls and sanctions to block all EU semiconductor
          and other tech-related exports to China.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beijing retaliates. Its Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) decrees: No
          longer will critical raw materials, including gallium, germanium, and
          rare earths, or critical components that contain these materials such
          as wafers for semiconductor manufacturing and permanent magnets, be
          exported to any country imposing sanctions or complying with US
          (extraterritorial) sanctions. Beijing pulls the rug from under allied
          defence industries, banning exports of critical materials and
          components altogether for the duration of the conflict. After all, the
          CCP leadership fears that “untrusted countries” will circumvent an
          otherwise targeted ban against them.

    <p>
      Achieving security of supply requires vertically integrating industries,
      all the way from the current point of direct dependence on China to the
      extraction of raw materials. Participants note that reshoring or
      friend-shoring just one or several production steps in the value chain
      does not actually secure supply. This kind of scattered de-risking
      approach simply creates a new critical economic input for which the EU
      directly relies on China. For example, in addition to dominating permanent
      magnet production, approximately 90% of all rare earth refining takes
      place in China. Even if the EU on-shores permanent magnet-making, Beijing
      could still (threaten to) weaponize the supply of materials needed to
      produce these components. Therefore, securing supply requires that EU and
      partner industries move their entire supply chain outside of China.
      Introducing measures in the correct order and at the right time is of the
      utpmost importance. Many participants advocate first generating supply
      outside of China (promote), and only then shielding EU markets from
      China’s power trade tactics, such as its flooding of the market with below
      market-price products and its weaponisation of supply (protect). Both
      promote and protect measures should be coordinated with partners
      (partner). If production does not yet take place outside of China at scale
      but the EU and its partners already disincentivise supply from China,
      steep price increases, and perhaps even shortages may occur. This is
      especially true in today’s constrained gallium and germanium markets.
      China has already capped the exports of these materials. Even worse, China
      could aggravate shortages caused by a protect-first-promote-later strategy
      by retaliating early, for instance by artificially cutting -off supply to
      the EU. Conversely, if the EU introduces promote measures first, but does
      not adopt protect measures soon after, then Beijing is in a strong
      position to undercut vulnerable competitors. China could simply flood the
      market with cheap components and materials to put EU and partner
      production out of business. In short, participants find that promote
      measures should kickstart EU and partner production. Protect measures
      ought to follow soon after to ensure the longer-term financial viability
      of EU and partner producers.
