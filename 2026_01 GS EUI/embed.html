<h1>Global Risks to the EU in 2026: What are the main conflict threats for Europe? </h1>
<!-- intro -->
<p>
    Europe’s security environment in 2026 is bleak and uncertain. The transatlantic relationship is under exceptional
    strain. Negotiations for a ceasefire in Ukraine have so far proven unsuccessful – if not outright damaging to the
    peace process. Russia has elevated its aggressive posture towards Europe and continues to launch hybrid attacks
    across the continent. In the face of these converging issues, which threats should EU policymakers prioritise? </p>
<p>
    To answer this question, the EUISS partnered for the second year in a row with the Robert Schuman Centre for
    Advanced Studies at the European University Institute (EUI) to run the Global Risks to the EU expert survey.
    Conducted with the support of the Trans European Policy Studies Association (TEPSA) and the European Initiative for
    Security Studies (EISS), the project is the first comprehensive, continent-wide assessment of how European experts
    perceive conflict related risks to EU security.

        <div class="card" data-step="1">
            <p>
                501 experts answered the survey. All experts included are members of the EUISS, EUI, TEPSA, and EISS
                networks and self-identified as having EU expertise, with close to 40% identifying as EU foreign policy
                experts. 96% hold at least a master's degree, and over 50% hold a PhD. We asked them to rank the
                likelihood and expected impact of 30 predefined risks affecting EU security in 2026. These are the main
                threats they identified. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="2">
            <p>
                The top risks identified by experts are a disruptive attack on EU critical infrastructure, Russia’s
                continued aggression in Europe and against its neighbours, US withdrawal from its security guarantees,
                and a military conflict between China and Taiwan. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="3">
            <h2>
                Hybrid attacks top the chart </h2>
            <p>
                Europe’s top risk in 2026 is not a tank column crossing into EU territory – it is a disruptive hybrid
                strike on critical infrastructure. For 2026, experts rate this as the most likely scenario and one of
                the most impactful. Such an attack would not aim to defeat Europe militarily but to break it
                politically: subsea cable sabotage, a prolonged power-grid shutdown, or coordinated disruption across
                digital and transport systems could paralyse daily life, rattle markets, and trigger a crisis of
                governability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hostile states, Russia primarily, and their proxies are already probing Europe’s cables, pipelines, and
                networks. Experts’ message is direct: deterrence in 2026 depends as much on redundancy, rapid repair,
                cross-continental coordination, and societal preparedness as on classic military instruments. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="4">
            <h2>
                Russia is betting on erosion
            </h2>
            <p>
                Russia remains at the centre of Europe’s threat picture in 2026 – although experts do not expect a
                direct NATO–Russia war. Instead, the highest risk is that of the slow-burn actions that steadily degrade
                Europe’s security environment while remaining below NATO’s retaliation thresholds.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most prominent risk is a ceasefire in Ukraine on Russia’s terms, which experts rate as a top-tier
                risk on both likelihood and impact. The concern here is not simply territorial loss. It is setting a
                strategic precedent: a settlement that locks in gains through force, rewards aggression, and leaves
                Ukraine structurally vulnerable would signal that Europe cannot shape its own security environment. In
                that world, deterrence weakens, and the EU inherits a permanently unstable frontier.
            </p>
            <p>Second, experts expect a new Russian military action in non-NATO neighbouring states, rating it as a high
                risk and more likely than a direct NATO–Russia clash. Moscow’s preferred tactic remains the use of
                pressure, coercion, and military moves against softer targets where the costs are lower and the
                ambiguity is higher. The survey also flags the possibility of Georgia fully submitting to a
                Russia-directed agenda, reinforcing the picture of a neighbourhood being reshaped through intimidation,
                capture, and opportunistic escalation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Taken together, the Russia signal in 2026 is grimly practical: Europe faces a drawn-out contest of
                attrition, not a single decisive showdown – a campaign to normalise Russian influence at the EU’s edge
                and make insecurity feel routine.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="5">
            <h2>
                US withdrawal would have a nuclear impact </h2>
            <p>
                Despite the new 5% defence spending pledge, one year of Trump 2.0 has not assuaged fears of a US
                pullback from security guarantees to European allies. This scenario remains strategically seismic and
                plausibly imminent for experts, like in 2025. This event would be as impactful on Europe as Russian
                nuclear use, while being significantly more likely. Europe’s main military alliance is now perceived as
                a source of risk.
            </p>
            <p>
                This may not mean that Washington’s presence vanishes overnight. But Europe is being forced to confront
                a harsher reality: deterrence depends on credibility, and credibility depends on political commitment.
                If European experts price US commitment as uncertain, the entire deterrence edifice becomes shakier:
                adversaries start believing they can probe, sabotage, and escalate without triggering a unified
                response. Renewed US threats to annex Greenland only worsen this predicament.
            </p>
            <p>
                A US-backed NATO still has deterrent power (making a NATO-Russia direct war an unlikely risk for 2026),
                but the EU is nowhere near able to replace US guarantees in the short term.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="6">
            <h2>
                Cross-theatre risks
            </h2>
            <p>
                Going beyond the Euro-Atlantic theatre, the risk for a cross-strait military conflict between China and
                Taiwan has increased this year compared to 2025 results, moving into the high-risk tier and reflecting
                both Beijing’s increasing boldness and the significant impact that a blockade of Taiwan would have for
                Europe. Still, the chances for the US to enter in a military conflict with China to defend Taiwan are
                seen as the lowest-likelihood scenario among the 30. This is a further signal of reduced US credibility
                as the defender of last resort.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2025, experts successfully predicted a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran, placing it as a
                high-risk event. A renewed escalation is placed as a mid-tier risk for 2026, reflecting perhaps Iran’s
                reduced military capabilities. A return to hostilities between Israel and Hamas, instead, is seen as a
                high-likelihood event, with a moderate impact on the EU. Other moderate risks include renewed fighting
                in the Red Sea, destabilising armed conflict in Libya, and aggressive Chinese action in the South China
                Sea.

<h2>
    Transatlantic expert alignment
</h2>
<p>
    Like last year, we ran the Global Risks survey at the same time as the Council on Foreign Relations s
    Preventive Priorities Survey, which probed US experts. </p>
<div class="container-comparison">
    <div class="scroll-content-comparison">
        <div class="card" data-step="10">
            &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="11">
            Comparing the results shows real alignment across
            the transatlantic expert community on the big picture: Russia’s threat and the war in Ukraine remain key
            priorities, disruptions of critical infrastructure are no longer niche risks, and China’s coercion of
            Taiwan is an increasingly plausible scenario. The US survey also places the Middle East high on the
            agenda, even higher than the Global Risks survey: US experts anticipate renewed fighting in Gaza and the
            wider risk of escalation feeding regional instability, including spillover in a renewed Israel-Iran war.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the US outlook (☆) is also becoming more inward – and more neighbourhood-focused. CFR experts
                elevate US
                political violence – growing unrest and domestic instability – as a top risk, whereas domestic violence
                in Europe is a remote risk for EU experts (○). The CFR survey also predicted direct US strikes in
                Venezuela
                to change the Maduro regime, putting it as a top risk, whereas in the Global Risks survey this is a
                low-impact event for European security.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="12">
            <p>
                The overlap in risk perceptions is meaningful: both sides fear coercion, disruption, and escalation by
                major powers. Yet the survey results also show that the United States is weighing an increasingly
                domestic and distinct risk portfolio in which Europe is one theatre among several.

<h2>Shaping Europe’s security in 2026</h2>
<p>
    The picture painted in the Global Risks survey is that of a complex, interconnected set of threats to the EU in the
    year ahead. As power politics makes a comeback, and traditional alliances are less reliable, the risk of conflict in
    Europe’s periphery, reaching EU Member States, is growing. But rather than admiring the problem, the EU must
    actively shape it.
</p>
<p>
    EU leaders must zero in on the most critical risks. They must take the bulk of deterrence against Russia, while
    actively ‘unpowering’ the Kremlin from the conventional to the hybrid domain: deny the Kremlin leverage over
    European societies and infrastructure, punish aggression and hybrid attacks in ways that impose real costs, and
    manage escalation so deterrence holds without sleepwalking into a wider war.
</p>
<p>
    Relatedly, the EU must actively shape negotiations over Ukraine’s future peace. Even if it is not invited to the
    table, it can still influence the outcome by sustaining Ukraine’s battlefield viability and long-term defence
    posture – so that any pause in fighting does not become a reset for Russian rearmament. The broader goal remains to
    secure a seat in the talks, so that European interests are represented directly.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, the EU must be clear-eyed about the direction of travel other actors have taken. The US is no longer a
    trustworthy partner, and the credibility of the American umbrella is in question – with major consequences for
    European deterrence. The continent must also prepare for the fallout of a major war in the Indo-Pacific, a
    resumption of violence in the Middle East, or the ripple effects of crises in other theatres. As the world changes
    and risks multiply, the EU must not remain anchored to outdated assumptions.
