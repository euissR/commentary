Microcontrollers,"Semiconductors handling high power voltages at high switching speeds with a wide range of applications, such as consumer electronics, radio-frequency applications, transportation technology, and automotive",Market structure,Concentration of supply,"The concentration of the microcontroller supply market is not to China’s advantage. Of the five leading suppliers controlling 82% of the market, not even one is headquartered in the PRC.",low
Microcontrollers,"Semiconductors handling high power voltages at high switching speeds with a wide range of applications, such as consumer electronics, radio-frequency applications, transportation technology, and automotive",Market structure,Origin of demand,"Around 30% of the global demand for microcontrollers originates in China. Chinese consumer electronics and home appliance providers are among the key drivers of a demand that is likely to triple until 2033. Localisation trends have mixed implications as demand is high within China, but also globally including in the EU.",medium
Microcontrollers,"Semiconductors handling high power voltages at high switching speeds with a wide range of applications, such as consumer electronics, radio-frequency applications, transportation technology, and automotive",Market structure,Shortage risk,"The supply of microcontrollers continues to be tight; shortages remain likely. This should favour the newcomers to the market, including Chinese firms.",high
Microcontrollers,"Semiconductors handling high power voltages at high switching speeds with a wide range of applications, such as consumer electronics, radio-frequency applications, transportation technology, and automotive",Technological characteristics,Substitutability,"Microcontrollers are highly dependent on specialised software and therefore difficult to substitute. The better the software stack, the easier it is for developers to program the microcontroller. Customers tend to trust their suppliers because they know the microcontrollers and the respective software stack. Ripping and replacing microcontrollers is difficult.",low
Microcontrollers,"Semiconductors handling high power voltages at high switching speeds with a wide range of applications, such as consumer electronics, radio-frequency applications, transportation technology, and automotive",Technological characteristics,Product life cycles,"The life cycles of products using microcontrollers diverge greatly across economic sector. The sector with the highest demand, the automotive sector, has long product life cycles and so has the fourth largest sector, medical devices. However, almost 25% of microcontroller demand stems from consumer electronics with short product life cycles.",medium
Microcontrollers,"Semiconductors handling high power voltages at high switching speeds with a wide range of applications, such as consumer electronics, radio-frequency applications, transportation technology, and automotive",Overall risk,Overall risk,The risk to European economic security is rather low primarily because the substitutability is low. This implies that it is difficult for customers to replace non-Chinese microcontrollers with products supplied from Chinese manufacturers.,low
NAND flash memory,Chips for long-term memory indispensable to any device that runs software,Market structure,Concentration of supply,"Chinese companies hold low but rapidly expanding market shares. China’s leading NAND producer YMTC controls around 2% of global market share. This sounds like not a lot, but the company was only founded in 2016. Especially access to capital will be beneficial for a market expansion of YMTC. US export controls, however, could significantly limit the technological competitiveness of YMTC.",medium
NAND flash memory,Chips for long-term memory indispensable to any device that runs software,Market structure,Origin of demand,"Despite a high domestic demand for memory chips and a vivid localisation trend, China’s medium-term prospects are questionable due to export restrictions : If rigorously enforced, the export controls of the US, Japan and the Netherlands will make it very difficult for YMTC to innovate further and compete on international markets.",medium
NAND flash memory,Chips for long-term memory indispensable to any device that runs software,Market structure,Shortage risk,"Risks of memory chips supply shortages exist and support the expansion of newcomers. However, in the medium-term, NAND memory demand will move to higher performance that Chinese suppliers cannot meet if the export controls are comprehensively enforced.",medium
NAND flash memory,Chips for long-term memory indispensable to any device that runs software,Technological characteristics,Substitutability,"NAND memory chips are highly interchangeable. By design, these chips are easy to rip and replace. The substitutability is high.",high
NAND flash memory,Chips for long-term memory indispensable to any device that runs software,Technological characteristics,Product life cycles,"The products that require NAND flash memory have mostly short product life cycles. These are primarily consumer electronics such as laptops, mobile phones but also servers. However, this also implies that the export controls can result in a short-lived competitiveness of Chinese NAND memory chips.",high
NAND flash memory,Chips for long-term memory indispensable to any device that runs software,Overall risk,Overall risk,"While several factors indicate a risk of growing Chinese dependencies on NAND flash memory supply, the EU remains relatively unaffected. Europe has no memory chip manufacturer and will therefore not lose market share. The direct consumption of memory chips in Europe is also low. NAND chips are also hardly threatening European national security. The risk of hardware backdoors or kill switches in NAND flash memory is negligible. Shortages of NAND flash memory supply would, however, impact Europe indirectly as it would come with shortages in all kinds of devices that use NAND flash memory chips.",medium
Power MOSFET,"Tiny computers on a single chip with a broad range of applications such as measuring, sensing, and controlling in consumer electronics, cars, energy grids, hospitals, and other sectors",Market structure,Concentration of supply,"China has a growing market share in power MOSFETs. The ten largest power MOSFET providers control 78% of the global market, of which three companies are Chinese with a combined market share of 10.4%. Chinese power MOSFET suppliers are well positioned to gain market share: For example, Silan is expanding its capacity with additional production capacity in Xiamen and Hangzhou.",high
Power MOSFET,"Tiny computers on a single chip with a broad range of applications such as measuring, sensing, and controlling in consumer electronics, cars, energy grids, hospitals, and other sectors",Market structure,Origin of demand,China has a strong demand in many of the end-user industries of power MOSFETs such as consumer electronics and automotives. Chinese power MOSFET suppliers profit from localisation trends. US export controls have no impact on power MOSFET because even 130 nm process node is frequently used to produce power MOSFETs.,high
