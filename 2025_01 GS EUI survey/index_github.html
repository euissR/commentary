    <p>
      The year 2025 began with a new series of security challenges for Europe:
      uncertainty over the future of the transatlantic relationship, hybrid
      attacks across the continent, and the question of how to approach a
      potential ceasefire in Ukraine. In the face of these converging issues,
      how can EU policymakers effectively identify and prioritise the most
      significant threats to European interests?
    </p>
    <p>
      To answer this question, the EUISS partnered with the European University
      Institute (EUI), the Trans European Policy Studies Association (TEPSA) and
      the European Initiative for Security Studies (EISS) to conduct a survey
      among European experts on the main risks to the Union in 2025. The
      surveyed experts are members of the EUISS, TEPSA, and EISS networks. 40%
      identified themselves as EU foreign policy experts, 98% hold at least a
      master's degree, and nearly 60% hold a PhD.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Global Risks to the EU project, launched by the Robert Schuman Centre
      at the European University Institute, represents the first comprehensive,
      continent-wide assessment of global risk perceptions among European
      experts.

        <div class="card" data-step="1">
          <p>
            At the end of 2024, the survey asked close to 400 unique respondents
            to rank the likelihood and expected impact of 30 predefined risks
            affecting EU interests – defined as coherence, unity, security and
            prosperity. The survey aims to generate strategic foresight for EU
            foreign policy, analyse foreign policy alignment within the EU, and
            facilitate transatlantic comparisons of strategic priorities.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="2">
          <p>
            The top risks identified by experts range from Russia’s continued
            aggression, to a potential US withdrawal from its security
            guarantees, to war in the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific. Here, we
            review the main risks and suggest what the EU should do to address
            them in a proactive way.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="3">
          <h2>Appeasing Russia – in Ukraine and beyond</h2>
          <p>
            Experts overwhelmingly view the defeat of Ukraine as a critical
            threat to EU interests, with a ceasefire favourable to Russia
            emerging as the top risk for 2025. Russia’s full-scale invasion of
            Ukraine and the Kremlin’s efforts to rewrite the post-Cold War order
            in Europe have fundamentally disrupted the EU’s security. Today,
            through its actions against Ukraine, Russia continues to put
            pressure on EU unity and policy coherence. The concern that the
            Trump administration could push for negotiations with Russia while
            bypassing Ukraine and the EU’s interests likely contributed to the
            high importance that the experts attached to this risk. If Moscow
            were to secure a favourable ceasefire in Ukraine, leaving Kyiv
            defenceless and without a path towards Euro-Atlantic integration,
            the Kremlin could rearm and launch another attack in the near
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            EU experts also identify a high risk of new Russian military action
            in non-NATO neighbouring states. They furthermore foresee the risks
            emerging from the formation of pro-Russian governments in Georgia,
            and potentially in Moldova. However, the experts consider the risk
            of a confrontation between NATO and Russia to be moderate, assessing
            this to be of relatively low likelihood, reflecting confidence in
            NATO’s capacity to deter direct Russian attacks.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="4">
          <h2>US abandonment – in Europe and the Pacific</h2>
          <p>
            The withdrawal of American security guarantees to Europe also ranks
            among EU experts’ top concerns for 2025. Remarkably, in the view of
            these experts, US abandonment would have as high an impact on the EU
            as a Russian nuclear strike. This metric captures EU reliance on the
            United States for its security as perceived by the experts who
            clearly take President Donald Trump’s threat of not honouring US
            pledges towards NATO allies very seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, experts view a direct US-China military confrontation as
            unlikely in the short term, despite rating the likelihood of a
            cross-strait conflict between China and Taiwan as moderately high
            and the chances of Chinese aggression in the South China Sea as
            extremely high. This finding suggests that, in the event of Chinese
            aggression against US allies like Taiwan or the Philippines, the
            Trump administration would not act decisively to defend US interests
            in the region in 2025. However, EU experts acknowledge the
            significant impact that a potential US-China conflict would have on
            EU interests, reflecting the far-reaching influence of great power
            competition on global stability, EU security and economic
            prosperity.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="5">
          <h2>Hybrid and cyber threats</h2>
          <p>
            Experts rank the risk of disruptive hybrid attacks on EU
            infrastructure among the top threats to EU interests in 2025. Their
            assessment aligns with reports pointing to a heightened
            cybersecurity threat, driven by increased activity from hacktivists,
            cybercriminals and state-sponsored groups, especially since Russia’s
            full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the response reflects the growing frequency of
            physical attacks on critical infrastructure such as sabotaging
            subsea cables or burning ammunition factories. While direct conflict
            between NATO and Russia remains a lower-likelihood risk, European
            experts see a large-scale hybrid attack as having a moderate
            likelihood of occurring and of constituting a high-impact threat.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="6">
          <h2>No durable peace in the Middle East</h2>
          <p>
            Experts predict that a lasting ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is
            unlikely in 2025, ranking the ongoing conflict as one of the top
            risks to EU interests. Although a fragile ceasefire was brokered in
            January 2025, the absence of a long-term strategy to forge peace
            between the two sides will sustain high levels of tension. According
            to experts, this conflict will continue to strain the unity and
            coherence of EU policy in the Middle East. They also acknowledge the
            potential risk of a large-scale military confrontation between Iran
            and Israel, which they view as moderately likely to occur and
            believe would be highly impactful on EU interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Middle East geopolitical landscape, experts rank the collapse
            of the state of Lebanon as highly likely, though with moderate
            repercussions on EU interests. However, any of these conflicts could
            trigger large-scale migration towards the EU, which is seen as a
            high-risk scenario that would have a major impact on the continent.

    <h2>Time to act: Suggestions for EU policymakers</h2>
    <p>
      Faced with this gloomy picture, the EU has two choices: to despair, or to
      act. The Global Risks to the EU survey reveals overwhelming consensus
      among experts – across academia, think tanks, and policymaking circles –
      on the top issues affecting EU interests.
    </p>
    <div class="container-scatter">
      <div class="scroll-content-scatter">
        <div class="card" data-step="7"></div>
        <div class="card" data-step="8">
          <p>
            On average, policymakers and think tankers express slightly more
            concern than academics.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="9">
          <p>
            The main risks are also recognised across the territory of the
            Union. Although there was once a divide between Eastern and Western
            Europe regarding the threat posed by Russia, Moscow’s belligerence
            has now unified expert opinion. The lack of significant differences
            between respondents from different regions suggests that Europeans
            might be overcoming long-term divergences in threat perception. This
            unity of views presents an opportunity that the EU should not waste.

    </div>
    <p>
      Here are some ways in which the EU can start tackling the global risks
      with which it is confronted in 2025:
    </p>
    <h3>Prevent a bad deal</h3>
    <p>
      An unfavourable ceasefire imposed on Ukraine is the highest risk – but the
      range of potential negotiation outcomes could vary. The EU must be
      clear-eyed: if negotiations do begin, Kyiv’s battlefield strength and
      ability to deter future Russian attacks will determine its bargaining
      power. The EU must do everything in its power to ensure that Ukraine has
      the resources and support needed to sustain its defence at the required
      scale and strength. That will require working primarily at supranational
      level, but equally at the level of all 27 Member States, with key
      partners, and also in coalition-of-the-willing formats if there is no
      consensus.
    </p>
    <h3>A comprehensive Russia strategy</h3>
    <p>
      Developing a coherent strategy for the EU’s future dealings with Russia is
      crucial for European security. The EU must forge a coherent and unified
      political, economic and military posture towards an autocratic belligerent
      neighbour, one that will endure beyond any potential ceasefire in Ukraine.
      That strategy should emphasise the need to isolate Russia from the EU’s
      economy and deter the Kremlin from launching future attacks. The survey
      indicates that Russia is less likely to use nuclear weapons than the
      Kremlin’s red-line threats suggest. While the EU should not entirely
      dismiss these warnings, it must be prepared to take more decisive action
      against Moscow – especially since experts do not foresee a regime change
      in Russia anytime soon.
    </p>
    <h3>Spend big on defence</h3>
    <p>
      If US abandonment of Europe constitutes a threat of nuclear proportions,
      Europeans must allocate the appropriate resources to address it. A major
      increase in defence spending in the first half of 2025 – ahead of the NATO
      summit – will send a strong signal to the US that Europe is serious about
      defending itself, together with Washington, but alone if necessary. The EU
      should leverage the upcoming White Paper on the future of European defence
      to provide the right incentives to support Member States in this effort.
      The White Paper should focus on building an integrated European defence
      market with emphasis on joint procurement, proposing a coordinated
      rearmament strategy, and supporting defence purchases outside the EU to
      cover immediate shortfalls.
    </p>
    <h3>Go on the cyber-hybrid offensive</h3>
    <p>
      The growing number of attacks on European critical infrastructure shows
      that the current approach is not deterring the Kremlin and its allies –
      which makes this risk so particularly high. The EU should take a more
      offensive approach to impose costs on its adversaries, encompassing both
      deterrence by denial (better protection of infrastructure and early
      warning) and by punishment (going after the perpetrators).
    </p>
    <h3>Think across theatres and partners</h3>
    <p>
      The survey reveals that crises and risks can move across theatres. The
      EU’s geographically closest partners, such as the UK or countries in the
      Western Balkans, face a similar set of risks. US abandonment, experts say,
      would be felt in Europe but also in the Indo-Pacific. Conflict in the
      latter region (South China Sea, Taiwan) would reverberate in Europe as
      well. Hence, this is not the time for parochial thinking. The EU should
      promote a common vision with both nearby and distant partners to deal with
      shared threats. Specifically, the EU must prioritise a clear and coherent
      vision regarding China’s role in its future economic and security
      strategies, making it a central focus of its agenda.
    </p>
    <h3>Don’t overlook other crises</h3>
    <p>
      Even as the EU zeroes in on its most critical threats, it cannot afford to
      retreat from the world. A recent survey reveals a tangled web of risks: a
      fragile Middle East ceasefire could collapse, potentially igniting a
      broader conflict with Iran. Meanwhile, while conflicts on the African
      continent – in Libya, Sudan, Ethiopia, the DRC or Mozambique – may seem
      remote, they still rank high on the risk scale, and any escalation could
      spur significant migration flows into Europe. With its military and
      civilian missions already established across conflict zones, the EU is
      well-positioned to project force and tackle the root causes of
      instability. This presents it with an opportunity to strengthen its global
      engagement.
    </p>
    <h2>Can we maintain alignment with the US?</h2>
    <p>
      The Global Risks to the EU survey is inspired by the Preventive Priorities
      Survey, which the Council of Foreign Affairs (CFR) has conducted among US
      experts since 2008. In 2025, the EUI and CFR coordinated their surveys to
      permit the comparison between the two groups of experts. This offers a
      rare glimpse into how American and European experts view the geopolitical
      threat landscape for the year ahead.
    </p>
    <div class="container-comparison">
      <div class="scroll-content-comparison">
        <div class="card" data-step="10"></div>
        <div class="card" data-step="11">
          <p>
            The results indicate a notable convergence of concerns on both sides
            of the Atlantic – ranging from the potential for renewed conflict
            with Russia, to the absence of peace in the Middle East, to
            escalating tensions with China.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="12">
          <p>
            A ceasefire favourable to Russia in Ukraine is a major risk for both
            sides of the Atlantic, questioning the rush to secure a peace deal
            from the Trump 2.0 administration. Neither American nor European
            experts foresee lasting peace in the Middle East, raising concerns
            over the fragility of the ceasefire brokered between Israel and
            Hamas in January 2025. Experts also agree on the high likelihood of
            Chinese aggression in the South China Sea (although US respondents
            tend to place East Asia contingency in a higher risk category than
            their EU counterparts).
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sticky-container">
        <div id="visualization-comparison"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The transatlantic relationship will appear fragile in the shadow of a
      confrontational Trump administration and a fragmented European leadership.
      There is little doubt that 2025 will be a turbulent year for Western
      cooperation. However, given the overlap in priorities across the Atlantic,
      there are clear opportunities for coordination. The key to unlocking this
      coordination will be political will.
