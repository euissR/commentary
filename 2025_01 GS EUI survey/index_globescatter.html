          <p>
            At the end of 2024, the survey asked close to 400 unique respondents
            to rank the likelihood and expected impact of 30 predefined risks
            affecting EU interests – defined as coherence, unity, security and
            prosperity. The survey aims to generate strategic foresight for EU
            foreign policy, analyse foreign policy alignment within the EU, and
            facilitate transatlantic comparisons of strategic priorities.

          <!-- <h2>First Section</h2> -->
          <p>
            The top risks identified by experts range from Russia’s continued
            aggression, to a potential US withdrawal from its security
            guarantees, to war in the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific. Here, we
            review the main risks and suggest what the EU should do to address
            them in a proactive way.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="3">
          <h2>Appeasing Russia – in Ukraine and beyond</h2>
          <p>
            Experts overwhelmingly view the defeat of Ukraine as a critical
            threat to EU interests, with a ceasefire favourable to Russia
            emerging as the top risk for 2025. Russia’s full-scale invasion of
            Ukraine and the Kremlin’s efforts to rewrite the post-Cold War order
            in Europe have fundamentally disrupted the EU’s security. Today,
            through its actions against Ukraine, Russia continues to put
            pressure on EU unity and policy coherence. The concern that the
            Trump administration could push for negotiations with Russia while
            bypassing Ukraine and the EU’s interests likely contributed to the
            high importance that the experts attached to this risk. If Moscow
            were to secure a favourable ceasefire in Ukraine, leaving Kyiv
            defenceless and without a path towards Euro-Atlantic integration,
            the Kremlin could rearm and launch another attack in the near
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            EU experts also identify a high risk of new Russian military action
            in non-NATO neighbouring states. They furthermore foresee the risks
            emerging from the formation of pro-Russian governments in Georgia,
            and potentially in Moldova. However, the experts consider the risk
            of a confrontation between NATO and Russia to be moderate, assessing
            this to be of relatively low likelihood, reflecting confidence in
            NATO’s capacity to deter direct Russian attacks.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="4">
          <h2>US abandonment – in Europe and the Pacific</h2>
          <p>
            The withdrawal of American security guarantees to Europe also ranks
            among EU experts’ top concerns for 2025. Remarkably, in the view of
            these experts, US abandonment would have as high an impact on the EU
            as a Russian nuclear strike. This metric captures EU reliance on the
            United States for its security as perceived by the experts who
            clearly take President Donald Trump’s threat of not honouring US
            pledges towards NATO allies very seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, experts view a direct US-China military confrontation as
            unlikely in the short term, despite rating the likelihood of a
            cross-strait conflict between China and Taiwan as moderately high
            and the chances of Chinese aggression in the South China Sea as
            extremely high. This finding suggests that, in the event of Chinese
            aggression against US allies like Taiwan or the Philippines, the
            Trump administration would not act decisively to defend US interests
            in the region in 2025. However, EU experts acknowledge the
            significant impact that a potential US-China conflict would have on
            EU interests, reflecting the far-reaching influence of great power
            competition on global stability, EU security and economic
            prosperity.

        <div class="card" data-step="5">
          <h2>Hybrid and cyber threats</h2>
          <p>
            Experts rank the risk of disruptive hybrid attacks on EU
            infrastructure among the top threats to EU interests in 2025. Their
            assessment aligns with reports pointing to a heightened
            cybersecurity threat, driven by increased activity from hacktivists,
            cybercriminals and state-sponsored groups, especially since Russia’s
            full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the response reflects the growing frequency of
            physical attacks on critical infrastructure such as sabotaging
            subsea cables or burning ammunition factories. While direct conflict
            between NATO and Russia remains a lower-likelihood risk, European
            experts see a large-scale hybrid attack as having a moderate
            likelihood of occurring and of constituting a high-impact threat.
          </p>

        <div class="card" data-step="6">
          <h2>No durable peace in the Middle East</h2>
          <p>
            Experts predict that a lasting ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is
            unlikely in 2025, ranking the ongoing conflict as one of the top
            risks to EU interests. Although a fragile ceasefire was brokered in
            January 2025, the absence of a long-term strategy to forge peace
            between the two sides will sustain high levels of tension. According
            to experts, this conflict will continue to strain the unity and
            coherence of EU policy in the Middle East. They also acknowledge the
            potential risk of a large-scale military confrontation between Iran
            and Israel, which they view as moderately likely to occur and
            believe would be highly impactful on EU interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Middle East geopolitical landscape, experts rank the collapse
            of the state of Lebanon as highly likely, though with moderate
            repercussions on EU interests. However, any of these conflicts could
            trigger large-scale migration towards the EU, which is seen as a
            high-risk scenario that would have a major impact on the continent.
